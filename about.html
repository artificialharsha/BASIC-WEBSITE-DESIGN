             <p>                   Now that sri Sadhana group promoted by Sri Sadhan Educational & Service Society,markapurgrown 
into a grand multidimmensional structure incorporated 
with a perfect eduactional system in all its colleges remembers the age old Rome was not built in a day and its
 is not beyond imagination 
that behind this great accomplishment are the values and virtues like stringent commitment, unshaken determination
, perfec plan of action and 
untiring effort with candid concilation.</p>
<p>        As an old brush, eye's entrusted with task of framing a few words about Sri Sadhan degree college group. 'Hunger "is the
first and makes it run to fulfill the urge. Hence all the organisms naturally start fro its food or prey.</p></font>
<h1><b><u>THE HUNGRY BIRD LEAVES THE NEST :</u></b></h1><font size="5" >
<p>A quarter of post-graduates in different disciplines with distiction but with the same dream and fire happened to meet at an 
auspicious and opened thier minds,deliberated thier ideas and discussed the action plan of establishing a Junior college</p>
*to impart education where it is heoghly wanted<br>
*to make their lives secured<br>
*to provide employement for atleast a few un-employees</font>
<h1><b><u>LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP :</u></b></h1><font size="5">
<p>s the proverb says the gentlemen made an exhaustive,extensive and through survey as to where to setup the proposed Junior college
in the three revenue divisions viz.,chirala, kandukur, and markapur, the last one has struck the best and most favourable</p></font>
<h1><u><b>FORTUNE FAVOURS THE BRAVE :</u></b></h1><font size="5">
<p>As the aspirant have been braveand bold in thier venture, fortune also favoured them by offering a good 
number of feeding villages in the vicinities of Markapur which by then have been facing a complete 
void of the residential system of education at Junior college level and hence they have been sending their 
children to the irksome and affordable far off corporate colleges, the Hobson's choice for the haves 
and have nots.</p>
<p>Local conditions were also proved to be unfavourable and unsatisfiable to the parents because the existing Junior college
have been providing almost all day college education for intermediate students.These conditions favoured them, the directors 
Mr.V.R.K.PRASAD,Mr.M.V.KRISHNA REDDY,Mr.D.RAJAGOPAL REDDY,and Mr.G.LAVANYA RAMESH BABU to immediately register Sri Sadhana
Educational & Service Society and under that they established Sri Sadhana Junior College & Coaching Centre
at Jawahar Nagar Colony, Markapur in june 1999. The was officially recognized by the Board of Intermediate Education
, A.P Hyderabad in June 2001.</p>
